# Simple ingress with a single rule

This is the simplest possibility to create an ALB and a rule to expose the service to the internet.

Check the file [here](./1.ingress-single-rule.yaml)

However, this is not the more efficient way as whenever you create a new ingress a new ALB will be created, hence costs will grow as well. Hopefully there is an interesting annotation that we can use to improve it:

`alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/group.name: internal-alb`: We can assign multiple ingresses to the same ALB, however it requires more care and maintenance because changing the same parameter on different ingresses can cause issues.

## Rules priorities

When the ALB has only one ingress we have to care only about the order we add the rules in the ingress manifest.

Let's add more rules tConsidering the [ingress with a single rule](./1.ingress-single-rule.yaml)
